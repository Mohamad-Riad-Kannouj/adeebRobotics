This is my second project as a freelancer. I used Angular14 to build the client side, and I used nodeJS, and ExpressJS to build our backend and API app. Also, I deployed the website on NameCheap.

This is the list of npm packages used with our nodeJS app:
    1- express 
    2- body-parser
    3- cors
    4- node-fetch
    5- nodemailer
